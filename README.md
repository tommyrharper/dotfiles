My personal Mac setup, managed with nix-darwin and home-manager.
One repo, one command, and a fresh Mac ends up configured the same way every time.
It also supports a bare Ubuntu 22.04 LTS machine via standalone home-manager - see "Ubuntu setup" below.

## Contributing / Using This Repo

These are my personal dotfiles, shared publicly so people can read them, learn from them, and fork them freely.
Feature requests and pull requests are not accepted here, and PRs are auto-closed.
If you find a bug, please open a GitHub Issue using the bug report template.

## What you get

On macOS, running the switch builds:

- System settings (dark mode, key repeat, dock, Finder, trackpad)
- Homebrew apps (casks and CLI tools)
- Nix user packages (ripgrep, fd, fzf, jq, lazygit, Neovim, Hack Nerd Font, TeX Live)
- Shell (zsh, aliases, starship prompt)
- Editor (Neovim config with the rose-pine moon theme)
- Terminal (WezTerm config with the rose-pine moon theme and dimmed unfocused windows)
- Agent configs (Claude, Codex, opencode all share one AGENTS.md)
- Optional Pi theme and local extensions, generic UI settings and model overrides, plus two deliberately pinned third-party Pi packages

Ubuntu gets the shared shell, CLI packages, prompt, git, and symlinked dotfiles; see "Ubuntu setup" for the narrower Linux surface.

## Prerequisites

- Apple Silicon Mac, by default.
- Intel Mac: change one line.
  In `configuration.nix`, set `nixpkgs.hostPlatform = "x86_64-darwin";` (the comment right there tells you the same thing).
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS ("base free" - a plain install, no desktop environment) also works; see "Ubuntu setup" below instead of the macOS steps that follow.

## Fresh-machine setup

On a brand new Mac, from a bare clone of this repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kunchenguid/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

Before you run it: review "Make it yours" below.
Change the host label or CPU architecture if needed, and read the Homebrew cleanup warning.
`bootstrap.sh` applies the config to your machine, so do this first.

```sh
./bootstrap.sh
```

`bootstrap.sh` does five things, in order:

1. Installs Determinate Nix, if it isn't already installed.
2. Symlinks this repo to `~/.dotfiles`.
   This has to happen before the first build, because `home.nix` points at config files through `~/.dotfiles`.
3. Checks the `user` configured in `flake.nix` against your actual macOS username, and offers to fix it for you if they differ.
4. Trusts this repo for root, via `git config -f /etc/gitconfig --add safe.directory`.
   `darwin-rebuild` always runs via `sudo`, so root evaluates this flake's `git+file://` input; without this, libgit2 refuses to open a repo owned by another user.
5. Runs the first `darwin-rebuild switch`.
   It fetches the `darwin-rebuild` tool from the nix-darwin 26.05 release branch, then applies this repo's locked flake config.

After that, `darwin-rebuild` exists and you're on the normal workflow below.

### Validate without applying

Once Nix is installed (`bootstrap.sh` step 1 handles that), you can check that the config builds without touching your system - handy when you have edited something:

```sh
nix flake check --no-build
nix build .#darwinConfigurations.mac.system --dry-run
```

If you renamed the host label in "Make it yours", substitute your label for `mac` in these commands. On Ubuntu, substitute `.#homeConfigurations."<user>@<system>".activationPackage` (e.g. `thomasharper@x86_64-linux`) for the `darwinConfigurations.mac.system` output.

Run the test suite with:

```sh
./test.sh
```

## Daily use

Edit the config files in place, then apply:

```sh
./rebuild.sh
```

That's it.
No separate build-and-copy step.

## Ubuntu setup

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS ("base free" - a plain install, no desktop environment, nothing pre-configured) is supported through a separate, simpler path: standalone home-manager, not nix-darwin. After Nix is installed, the managed config is user-level only: no sudo rebuild, no Homebrew, no system-level config - just your shell, git, starship, zoxide, and the symlinked dotfiles under `home/`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kunchenguid/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./bootstrap.sh
```

On Linux, `bootstrap.sh` does six things: installs Determinate Nix (same installer as macOS), symlinks this repo to `~/.dotfiles`, offers to fix the `user` line in `flake.nix` if it doesn't match your Ubuntu username, runs the first `home-manager switch --flake ~/.dotfiles#<user>@<system>` (pinned to the home-manager `release-26.05` branch, same pattern as the macOS `darwin-rebuild` bootstrap), makes `~/.nix-profile/bin/zsh` your login shell, then installs Ubuntu's `uidmap` package (see "Rootless Docker" below). `<system>` is `x86_64-linux` or `aarch64-linux`, detected from `uname -m`. After that, `./rebuild.sh` works the same way it does on macOS.

The last two steps are the only ones here that need `sudo`. The login-shell one matters more than it looks: this repo configures `programs.zsh` and nothing else, so on a box still logging you into Ubuntu's default `/bin/bash` none of it is ever sourced - no aliases, and no `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` (see "Persistent ssh-agent" below), which shows up as every `git pull` re-prompting for your key passphrase. The step adds the Nix zsh to `/etc/shells`, and refuses to switch if that zsh doesn't start: `sshd` hands you your login shell and nothing else, so a broken one locks you out of the machine. If `sudo` is unavailable or denied it warns and prints the two commands to run by hand rather than aborting a bootstrap that has otherwise fully succeeded. Open a new SSH session afterwards to pick it up. macOS already logs into zsh, so it skips this. The `uidmap` step is fault-isolated the same way, and is explained below.

### Rootless Docker

On Linux, `home.nix` runs Docker as a rootless `systemd --user` service (`systemctl --user status docker`), and sets `DOCKER_HOST` to `unix:///run/user/$(id -u)/docker.sock` so the CLI finds it. `pkgs.docker` already carries `dockerd-rootless` and the rootlesskit/slirp4netns/fuse-overlayfs it shells out to, so `rebuild.sh` covers everything except one file: setuid `/usr/bin/newuidmap`. RootlessKit execs it by name to apply your `/etc/subuid` range, and a Nix store binary can never be setuid - hence the `sudo apt-get install -y uidmap` in `bootstrap.sh`'s step 6. Without it the unit starts and immediately dies with `newuidmap: executable file not found in $PATH`. The daemon survives between SSH sessions for the same reason the ssh-agent does: `enable-linger` (see "Persistent ssh-agent"). macOS gets Docker from Colima instead, so none of this applies there.

What you get is intentionally narrower than the macOS setup: no Homebrew casks/GUI apps (there's no desktop environment to run them), and no macOS-only CLI tools (`thefuck`, `echidna`, `solc-select`, `tenderly`, `postgresql`, `libpq`, `colima` - see `tools.nix`'s `platform = "macos"` entries). Of the fast-moving `platform = "all"` tools (`claude-code`, `codex`, `cursor-agent`, `herdr`, `skills`, `pi-coding-agent`, `gnhf`, `opencode`, `treehouse`), `tool-selection.nix`'s `useNative` correctly identifies all nine as needing a non-Nix installer on Ubuntu (see "Package metadata" below), and all nine are wired up: each `tools.nix` entry carries either a `nativeInstallUrl` pointing at the tool's own non-interactive installer script (`claude-code`, `codex`, `cursor-agent`, `herdr`, `pi-coding-agent`, `treehouse`) or a `nativeInstallNpmPackage` for tools with no install script that fits this loop's `~/.local/bin` convention, just an npm package (`skills`, `gnhf`, `opencode`). `no-mistakes` is a tenth `platform = "all"`/`updatePolicy = "fast"` entry that goes through this same native-install path on Ubuntu too, but unlike the other nine it has no Homebrew fallback at all (`hasHomebrew = false` - see "About `no-mistakes`" below), so it also takes the native-install path on macOS, which is why this activation script is no longer Ubuntu-only. `home.nix`'s `installNativeTools` activation script runs each one on every `rebuild.sh` (skipping the ones already present under their real `~/.local/bin` launcher name - see `nativeInstallBinName` for the three whose launcher name differs from their `tools.nix` entry name), with `CODEX_NON_INTERACTIVE=1`, `NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=$HOME/.local`, and `~/.local/bin` pre-created and pre-populated on `PATH` so none of them ever fall into an interactive prompt or a shell-rc-rewriting branch, and `~/.local/bin` on `home.sessionPath` so they're actually reachable afterward. `pkgs.nodejs` is included in `home.packages` on Linux because `skills`, `pi-coding-agent`, `gnhf`, and `opencode`'s launchers are npm-backed and shebang into `node` at runtime, not just during install. `NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=$HOME/.local` is *also* set declaratively via `home.sessionVariables` (Linux only), so it reaches every interactive shell and not just the activation script: without it a plain `npm root -g` resolves to the read-only `/nix/store/...-nodejs-slim/lib/node_modules` rather than `~/.local/lib/node_modules` where the npm-backed tools actually live, and a plain `npm install -g` targets the Nix store. That broke `tests/pi-calm.test.sh`, which finds the Pi package via `$(npm root -g)` and silently skipped every sub-check. It supersedes the hand-written `~/.npmrc` (`prefix=${HOME}/.local`) that was previously needed as a workaround - that file is unmanaged, a fresh bootstrap never had it, and you can delete it. Both exports are needed and must stay in sync: the generated Home Manager `activate` script runs with its own curated environment and never sources `hm-session-vars.sh`, so `home.sessionVariables` is not in scope during activation. macOS is unaffected - it gets these tools from Homebrew, and the attribute is gated with `lib.optionalAttrs` so it is entirely absent from the darwin evaluation.

## Make it yours

This repo is mine.
If you clone it, review these before you run `bootstrap.sh`:

- **Username**: run `./bootstrap.sh` (it detects your username and offers to set it) OR change the single `user = "kunchen"` line in `flake.nix`.
  Everything else (`configuration.nix`, `home.nix`, home directory paths) is threaded from that one variable.
- **Host label**: change the single `hostLabel = "mac";` line in `flake.nix` (`rebuild.sh`/`bootstrap.sh` read it back out, so nothing else needs editing).
- **CPU architecture**: on macOS, set `hostPlatform` in `configuration.nix` (see Prerequisites above); on Ubuntu, `bootstrap.sh` and `rebuild.sh` map `uname -m` to `x86_64-linux` or `aarch64-linux`.

**Private shell values:** copy `home/.config/zsh/private-env.zsh.example` to
`home/.config/zsh/private-env.zsh` and fill in any local-only values you want
the shell to use. The real file is ignored by Git. For example, setting
`HETZNER_HOST` there enables the `hetzner` zsh alias as `ssh <user>@$HETZNER_HOST`
without committing the host value to this public repo.

**SSH config:** `~/.ssh/config` itself is never managed by home-manager - it
stays local so Colima and other tools can rewrite it freely, and rebuild
never overwrites or regenerates it. Instead, `home.nix` symlinks two
dotfiles-owned fragments into `~/.ssh/` and idempotently prepends `Include`
lines for them to `~/.ssh/config` on every rebuild (an activation script;
safe to run repeatedly - it never duplicates the `Include` lines and never
touches the rest of the file, so Colima's own appended entries survive):

- `~/.ssh/dotfiles.config.public` - safe, general defaults (github.com and
  `Host *` identity settings), symlinked from the committed, per-platform
  `home/.ssh/dotfiles.config.public.darwin` or `.linux`.
- `~/.ssh/dotfiles.config.private` - your real per-host entries
  (hostnames/IPs, usernames, ports, identity files), symlinked from
  `home/.ssh/dotfiles.config.private`. Copy
  `home/.ssh/dotfiles.config.private.example` to
  `home/.ssh/dotfiles.config.private` and fill it in; the real file is
  ignored by Git.

On a new machine, the first `home-manager switch` creates `~/.ssh/config` if
missing and wires in both `Include` lines automatically - no manual paste.
On a machine that already used this repo's older SSH setup, rebuild once to
add the new `Include` lines. If you used the old
`home/.ssh/config.private` file, copy its entries into
`home/.ssh/dotfiles.config.private`; it is not renamed automatically.

**Persistent ssh-agent (Linux only):** `home.nix` enables home-manager's
`services.ssh-agent` on Linux, which runs a `systemd --user` unit that starts
on login with `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` wired into zsh automatically. Note *zsh*: that
module only injects the socket into the shells home-manager manages, so the
agent is invisible from a `bash` login shell - which is why `bootstrap.sh`
makes zsh your login shell on Ubuntu. On headless Ubuntu,
the config also enables systemd lingering so the user service, ssh-agent, and
cached keys survive after the SSH session that ran `rebuild.sh` closes.
Combined with `AddKeysToAgent yes` above, this means a key's passphrase only
needs to be entered once per boot or agent restart, even on a minimal server
with no desktop environment or gnome-keyring. macOS is untouched - it already
gets a persistent agent for free via launchd and the Keychain (`UseKeychain`
above).

**Git identity:** this config deliberately does not set your git name or email.
Git will stop your first commit and tell you to set them (`git config --global user.name "Your Name"` and `git config --global user.email you@example.com`).
If you'd rather manage that declaratively, add this back to `home.nix` with your own identity:

```nix
programs.git = {
  enable = true;
  settings.user = {
    name = "Your Name";
    email = "you@example.com";
  };
};
```

**Homebrew cleanup warning:** `configuration.nix` sets `homebrew.onActivation.cleanup = "zap"`.
That means every time you switch on macOS, Homebrew removes any package or cask on your machine that isn't selected from `tools.nix` into `configuration.nix`'s `homebrew.brews` and `homebrew.casks`.
If you already have Homebrew stuff installed that isn't in that list, the first switch will uninstall it.
Read through the Homebrew-selected entries in `tools.nix` before you run `bootstrap.sh` or `rebuild.sh` for the first time, and add anything you want to keep.

**Existing Homebrew install:** `configuration.nix` sets `nix-homebrew.autoMigrate = true`, so if `/opt/homebrew` already has a non-Nix Homebrew install on it (common on a Mac you were already using), the first switch migrates it in place under nix-homebrew's management instead of erroring out. Your existing taps and packages are kept; the `zap` cleanup above still applies on top of that.

**Existing dotfiles:** `flake.nix` sets `home-manager.backupFileExtension = "before-home-manager"`.
On a Mac you were already using, files like `~/.zshrc`, `~/.zshenv`, or `~/.claude/settings.json` likely already exist.
Without this setting, home-manager refuses to activate rather than clobber them.
With it, the first switch moves each conflicting file to `<name>.before-home-manager` next to it and links in this repo's version instead - diff the two afterward if you want to carry anything over.

**About `herdr`:** it's a `scope = "basic"` entry in `tools.nix`.
It's a real public Homebrew formula (`brew info herdr` finds it in homebrew-core, no tap needed), so it will install fine on macOS.
If you don't use it, remove its entry from `tools.nix` and the matching `installHerdrAgentIntegrations` activation block from `home.nix` in your copy.
`herdr` has no built-in declarative way to enable its Claude/Codex/Pi agent integrations (`herdr integration --help` shows only an imperative `install <target>` subcommand), so `home.nix`'s `installHerdrAgentIntegrations` activation script runs `herdr integration install claude/codex/pi` on every rebuild, on both platforms - the install is idempotent (safe to re-run, exits 0 whether or not the target agent's own CLI is present) and each run is fault-isolated with a `WARNING:` so one failing target never blocks the others. It resolves `herdr` off an explicit PATH (`~/.local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`) rather than assuming activation's curated PATH already has it - see the `loginctl` comment on `enableSshAgentLinger` for why. Its Pi hook lands inside `~/.pi/agent/extensions`, which is a tracked, symlinked directory in this repo, so the generated `herdr-agent-state.ts` is gitignored rather than committed - it's regenerated fresh every rebuild.

**About `cursor-agent`:** it's a `scope = "basic"` entry in `tools.nix`.
Cursor's current CLI installs the `agent` command via `curl https://cursor.com/install -fsS | bash` on macOS, Linux, and WSL, with `~/.local/bin` on PATH afterward. The macOS path uses Homebrew's `cursor-cli` cask instead (`brewName = "cursor-cli"`, `isCask = true`), while Ubuntu uses that official installer through `nativeInstallUrl = "https://cursor.com/install"` and skips future rebuild installs by checking for `~/.local/bin/agent` (`nativeInstallBinName = "agent"`).

**About `gnhf`:** it's a `scope = "basic"` entry in `tools.nix`.
It's a real public Homebrew formula (`brew info gnhf` finds it in homebrew-core, no tap needed) that depends on `node`, resolved by Homebrew itself on macOS; on Ubuntu it installs via its own npm package of the same name.

**About `opencode`:** it's a `scope = "basic"` entry in `tools.nix`.
It's a real public Homebrew formula (`brew info opencode` finds it in homebrew-core, no tap needed) that depends on `node` and `ripgrep`, resolved by Homebrew itself on macOS. It does have an official non-interactive `install.sh` (`curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash`), but that script hardcodes its install location to `$HOME/.opencode/bin` with no env var to redirect it, unlike `claude-code`/`codex`/`cursor-agent`/`herdr`/`pi-coding-agent`'s installers which respect (or default to) `~/.local/bin` - so it doesn't fit `nativeInstallUrl`'s "already installed" skip-check or `home.sessionPath` without extra plumbing. Its npm package (`opencode-ai`, bin: `opencode`) lands in `~/.local/bin` the same way `skills`/`gnhf` do, so Ubuntu uses `nativeInstallNpmPackage` instead.
If you don't use it, just remove its entry from `tools.nix` in your copy.

**About `no-mistakes`:** it's a `scope = "basic"` entry in `tools.nix`.
Unlike the other fast-moving `platform = "all"` tools above, it has no Homebrew formula or tap at all (`brew info no-mistakes` finds nothing, and the `kunchenguid/homebrew-no-mistakes` tap doesn't exist) and no npm package either - its only fresh-machine install path is its own `install.sh`. It sets `hasHomebrew = false`, which tells `tool-selection.nix`'s `useHomebrew`/`useNative` to route it through the native installer on both macOS and Ubuntu instead of putting a nonexistent formula in `homebrew.brews`. That's also why `home.nix`'s `installNativeTools` activation script is no longer Ubuntu-only: it now runs on both platforms, and on macOS it only ever has `no-mistakes` to install since every other fast/all tool there still resolves through Homebrew.
If you don't use it, just remove its entry from `tools.nix` in your copy.

**About `treehouse`:** it's a `scope = "basic"` entry in `tools.nix` (a pool manager for reusable git worktrees/Jujutsu workspaces, from the same author as `no-mistakes`).
It is *not* in nixpkgs (`builtins.hasAttr "treehouse"` against this flake's own `nixpkgs` input is `false`, so a plain `nixName`/`updatePolicy = "stable"` entry would not evaluate), and the npm package called `treehouse` is an unrelated React state-management library, not this tool - so `nativeInstallNpmPackage` is out too. What it does have is a real public Homebrew formula (`brew info treehouse` finds `treehouse` in homebrew-core - "Manage worktrees without managing worktrees", homepage `github.com/kunchenguid/treehouse`, a Go build - no tap needed), so unlike `no-mistakes` it keeps the default `hasHomebrew = true` and stays Homebrew-managed on macOS like every other fast/`all` tool. On Ubuntu it uses `nativeInstallUrl = "https://kunchenguid.github.io/treehouse/install.sh"`: that script downloads the release tarball for the detected OS/arch and moves a single `treehouse` binary into `~/.local/bin` whenever that directory is on `$PATH` (which `installNativeTools` exports before running it), and it never writes to a shell rc file - the same shape as `claude-code`/`herdr`, and exactly what `opencode`'s hardcoded `$HOME/.opencode/bin` installer failed. Its launcher name matches its entry name, so no `nativeInstallBinName` is needed. Upstream also publishes a `flake.nix` (`nix run github:kunchenguid/treehouse`), but using it would mean adding this repo's first third-party flake input - new machinery for one tool - so the existing Homebrew + `install.sh` paths are used instead.
The one wrinkle its installer forced: it decides between `~/.local/bin` and a `sudo`-requiring `/usr/local/bin` with a `[ -w "$INSTALL_DIR" ]` test *before* it `mkdir -p`s, so `installNativeTools` now creates `~/.local/bin` itself rather than depending on an earlier tool in the loop having created it as a side effect.
If you don't use it, just remove its entry from `tools.nix` in your copy.

**Package metadata:** `tools.nix` is the single source of truth for every CLI tool and GUI app. Each entry answers these questions:

| Property       | Question                                        | Values                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `scope`        | Do I need this on a minimal dev machine?          | `basic` / `personal`          |
| `platform`     | Where does this tool make sense?                  | `all` / `macos` / `ubuntu`    |
| `updatePolicy` | Do I want the latest upstream version quickly?    | `stable` / `fast`             |
| `isCask`       | If installed through Homebrew, is it a cask?      | `true` / omitted              |
| `hasHomebrew`  | Does this tool have a real Homebrew formula/cask? | `true` (default) / `false`    |

(`brewName`/`nixName` are optional overrides for when the Homebrew or nixpkgs name differs from the tool's `name`. `nativeInstallUrl` is an optional URL to a non-interactive, PATH-side-effect-free installer script for a `useNative` tool - see below and `home.nix`'s `installNativeTools` activation script; `claude-code`, `codex`, `cursor-agent`, `herdr`, `pi-coding-agent`, `no-mistakes`, and `treehouse` set it. `nativeInstallNpmPackage` is the same idea for a tool with no install script that fits the `~/.local/bin` convention - `skills`, `gnhf`, and `opencode` set it. `nativeInstallBinName` overrides the `~/.local/bin` launcher name the installer's "already installed" skip-check looks for, for the rare tool (`claude-code` -> `claude`, `cursor-agent` -> `agent`, `pi-coding-agent` -> `pi`) whose upstream launcher name differs from its `tools.nix` entry name; it defaults to `name`. `hasHomebrew` defaults to `true` for every entry; `no-mistakes` is the only one that sets it `false`, since it has no Homebrew formula or tap at all (`treehouse`, from the same author and also installed from its own `install.sh` on Ubuntu, keeps the default because it *does* have a homebrew-core formula - see "About `treehouse`" above) - that's what keeps a `platform = "all"`/`updatePolicy = "fast"` tool out of `homebrew.brews`/`homebrew.casks` on macOS and routes it through the native installer there too, instead of the Homebrew-always assumption every other fast/all tool relies on (see "About `no-mistakes`" above). `platform = "ubuntu"` is used by the `gcc`/`gnumake`/`pkg-config` build-toolchain entries, needed so nvim-treesitter can compile parsers on Ubuntu - macOS gets the same via Xcode Command Line Tools instead.)

`tool-selection.nix` turns that table into concrete selections in two stages. `configuration.nix` consumes those selections for macOS `environment.systemPackages`, `homebrew.brews`, and `homebrew.casks`; `home.nix` consumes them for both platforms' `home.packages` and, for the `nativeInstallTools` subset, an activation script (no longer Ubuntu-only - see "About `no-mistakes`" above) that runs each one's `nativeInstallUrl` script (or `npm install -g` for `nativeInstallNpmPackage`) directly. First, whether the tool exists on this machine at all:

```text
scope:
  basic setup    -> only scope=basic
  personal setup -> basic + personal

platform:
  platform=all             -> any OS
  platform=currentPlatform -> this OS
  anything else            -> skip
```

Only then is the installer picked, based on `currentPlatform`:

```text
macOS:
  stable + all              -> Nix
  fast + all + hasHomebrew  -> Homebrew
  fast + all + !hasHomebrew -> native installer (only wired up if nativeInstallUrl or nativeInstallNpmPackage is set)
  macos-only                -> Homebrew

Ubuntu:
  stable + all     -> Nix
  fast + all       -> native installer (only wired up if nativeInstallUrl or nativeInstallNpmPackage is set - see "Ubuntu setup")
  stable + ubuntu  -> Nix
  fast + ubuntu    -> native installer (only wired up if nativeInstallUrl or nativeInstallNpmPackage is set)
```

`currentPlatform` isn't one global constant: `configuration.nix` hardcodes it to `"macos"` (there's only one macOS target), while each Ubuntu `homeConfigurations."<user>@<system>"` output in `home.nix` derives it from `pkgs.stdenv.isDarwin`, so it's correct per-output rather than a single file-level toggle that would only ever be right for one platform at a time.

The invariant that keeps the macOS and Ubuntu paths aligned: installer selection always depends on `currentPlatform`, not on a tool's fields alone. A `platform=all; updatePolicy=fast; hasHomebrew=true` (the default) tool is Homebrew-managed only because `currentPlatform == "macos"` - on Ubuntu that same tool goes through `useNative` (a native installer) instead. A `platform=ubuntu` tool can never enter the Homebrew lists while `currentPlatform == "macos"`. The one exception is `hasHomebrew = false`: a tool with no real Homebrew formula (`no-mistakes`) goes through `useNative` on macOS too, since `useHomebrew` refuses to claim it there - see "About `no-mistakes`" above. `isCask` only decides `homebrew.casks` vs `homebrew.brews` for a tool the platform stage already selected for Homebrew - it plays no role in which installer is chosen. See `isEnabled`/`isForCurrentPlatform`/`useNix`/`useHomebrew`/`useNative`/`hasHomebrew` in `tool-selection.nix` (shared by `configuration.nix` and `home.nix`) for the exact predicates.

One toggle controls both scopes: flip `usePersonalSetup` in `flake.nix` to `false` for dev tooling only - handy for a second, non-personal machine (e.g. a server).

**Heads-up:**

- `home/AGENTS.md` is my personal agent policy, and `home.nix` installs it for Claude, Codex, and opencode.
  If you clone this repo, you'd silently inherit my agent instructions - edit or delete `home/AGENTS.md` if you don't want that.
- The `cc` and `co` shell aliases in `home.nix` are high-agency shortcuts: `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` and `codex -s workspace-write -a never`.
  They're convenient for me, but know what they do before you use them.

## Repo tour

- `flake.nix` - the entry point.
  Wires up nixpkgs, nix-darwin, home-manager, and nix-homebrew for the macOS `darwinConfigurations.mac` output, and nixpkgs + home-manager (standalone, no nix-darwin) for the Linux `homeConfigurations."<user>@<system>"` outputs; `usePersonalSetup` selects the brews/casks/Nix-package profile on both.
- `configuration.nix` - macOS-only system-level config: system defaults, Homebrew, and macOS package selection (see "Package metadata" above).
- `tools.nix` - the per-tool metadata table every platform selects packages from.
- `tool-selection.nix` - the shared `isEnabled`/`isForCurrentPlatform`/`useNix`/`useHomebrew`/`useNative` predicates and selected output lists that turn `tools.nix` into concrete installers for one `currentPlatform`; used by both `configuration.nix` (macOS) and `home.nix` (Ubuntu).
- `home.nix` - user-level config: shell, packages, prompt, and the symlinks described below. Shared between macOS and Ubuntu; platform-specific bits (home directory, Nix-managed package list, a couple of aliases) branch on `pkgs.stdenv.isDarwin`.
- `rebuild.sh` - re-applies the config after the first switch (macOS or Ubuntu).
  Run this every time you make a change.
- `home/` - the actual config files that get symlinked into place; the sections below explain the shared symlink model and Pi's narrower selective setup.

## How the symlinks work

The files under `home/` are the real files - editing them here is editing your live config, no rebuild needed to see the change in your editor.
`home.nix` uses `mkOutOfStoreSymlink` to point paths like `~/.config/nvim` straight at `home/.config/nvim` in this repo, so the two never drift out of sync.
You only run `./rebuild.sh` when you change something that isn't just a symlinked file, like a package list or a system default.

## Optional Pi configuration

Pi is an opt-in CLI, not a dependency this repository vendors. The CLI itself is selected through `tools.nix` like the other managed tools; see "Package metadata" for how macOS and Ubuntu choose its installer. If you adapt only this Pi config without the package metadata, install Pi from its owner with the [official Pi instructions](https://pi.dev).

[Pi Launcher](https://github.com/kunchenguid/homebrew-tap) is also optional and installed from its owner, not declared by this config:

```sh
brew install --cask kunchenguid/tap/pi-launcher
```

Home Manager owns exactly two repository-authored Pi directories: `~/.pi/agent/themes` and `~/.pi/agent/extensions`. It also links `models.json` and `settings.json` as individual files. The local extension directory is for public, repository-authored extensions only - third-party package code never belongs there. Run `/reload` after editing a local extension or other Pi resources. The terminal-title extension shows a spinner while Pi is working, then a completion mark with the session name or current directory. The `rose-pine-moon` theme was authored clean-room from the public [Rosé Pine Moon palette](https://rosepinetheme.com/palette) and Pi's [public theme schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earendil-works/pi/main/packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/theme/theme-schema.json), not from a private or live theme file.

### Pi Calm

`home/.pi/agent/extensions/calm` is a standalone local Pi extension. Home Manager's existing global extensions-directory link makes Pi auto-load it without another declaration. `/calm` toggles a conversation-only presentation mode and is off by default. Its choice is stored locally in `~/.pi/agent/calm` (or the directory selected by `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`), not in this repository or Home Manager. Adapted from Firstmate under the bundled MIT license, Calm imports no Firstmate modules and has no Firstmate runtime dependency.

When enabled, Calm hides collapsed thinking and the call/result shells for Pi's seven built-in tools (`read`, `bash`, `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `find`, and `ls`) without leaving blank transcript rows. During an active run it replaces Pi's working row with a two-line animated blue-water, yellow-boat widget. `/calm` restores Pi's stock rendering and preserves the existing Ctrl+O tool-expansion choice.

Calm never changes prompts, tool execution, model context, session data, or ordering. `/share` and `/export` use the complete stock transcript. Generic custom tools, images, and unsupported Pi transcript classes deliberately remain visible because Pi has no safe general-purpose transcript filter. If a future Pi release no longer exports the exact collapsed-thinking rendering seam, Calm logs one diagnostic and leaves only that adapter disabled; all other behavior remains available.

Pi's package system declares two third-party sources in the linked global `settings.json`:

- `npm:@ryan_nookpi/pi-extension-codex-fast-mode@0.2.6` - the exact public npm release from `ryan_nookpi`.
- `git:github.com/algal/pi-openai-server-compaction@c6d593087709e9481223dc6c6c2269b371b5e055` - the exact public `algal` commit for experimental OpenAI server-side compaction.

The version and commit are immutable pins, so Pi does not move them during package updates. Deliberate updates require a new source and security audit, followed by an explicit pin change in `home/.pi/agent/settings.json`. On Pi 0.82.0, global settings declarations install missing pinned packages automatically at startup. No one-time install command is required. Pi keeps the downloaded npm and git package trees in its own unmanaged `~/.pi/agent/npm` and `~/.pi/agent/git` runtime directories, outside Home Manager and Git tracking.

Both packages execute with your full user permissions and must be trusted like any other executable code. The compaction package is experimental, sends the relevant OpenAI compaction and continuity data to OpenAI, and upstream declares the stale peer range `>=0.80.9 <0.81.0`; this exact immutable ref was locally proven to load and perform remote compaction on Pi 0.82.0. Do not treat that proof as a guarantee for a different Pi version or a different package ref.

Home Manager deliberately does not manage `~/.pi/agent` itself, or Pi authentication, sessions, trust decisions, caches, npm/git package trees, or any other runtime state. The model overrides contain no credentials or endpoint settings, do not choose a default model, and only take effect after you authenticate Pi yourself. This remains an additive post-video layer: it does not vendor Pi, a launcher, or package source code into this repository.

## Notes

The first time you launch `nvim`, it bootstraps [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) by cloning plugins from GitHub.
That needs network access once; after that it's offline.
Neovim and WezTerm both use the rose-pine moon theme.
Neovim keeps italics off and uses a transparent background on macOS, Windows, and WSL so it matches the terminal setup.
