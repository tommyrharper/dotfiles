# Single source of truth for CLI/GUI tool metadata, shared by macOS
# (Homebrew + Nix) and Ubuntu (Nix + native installers).
#
# Field reference and selection-logic docs: README.md ("Package metadata").
# Selection logic that reads this table lives in ./tool-selection.nix,
# consumed by configuration.nix (macOS) and home.nix (Ubuntu).

  # Fast-moving CLI agents wanted on every machine - track upstream closely,
  # so Homebrew rather than a pinned nixpkgs version.
  # nativeInstallUrl: each of these ships an official install.sh that is
  # non-interactive and checksum-/registry-verified when no /dev/tty is
  # attached (confirmed by running each live in a clean Ubuntu 22.04
  # container - see tool-selection.nix's nativeInstallUrl helper and
  # home.nix's installNativeTools activation script for how CODEX_NON_INTERACTIVE,
  # NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX, and the pre-populated ~/.local/bin PATH keep all of
  # these out of shell-rc-mutation branches):
  # - claude-code: claude.ai/install.sh drops straight to ~/.local/bin/claude
  #   with no prompts and no rc edits, tty or not.
  # - codex: chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh only rewrites a shell profile when
  #   its target bin dir isn't already on $PATH; CODEX_NON_INTERACTIVE=1 also
  #   skips its "start now?"/uninstall-conflict prompts.
  # - pi-coding-agent: pi.dev/install.sh only prompts to install Node.js
  #   itself when Node isn't already on $PATH; with pkgs.nodejs present it
  #   detects no tty and proceeds via plain `npm install -g`.
  # nativeInstallBinName: the launcher binary these two installers actually
  # produce in ~/.local/bin differs from the tools.nix entry name (upstream
  # naming, not ours) - home.nix's "already installed" skip check needs the
  # real binary name or it would re-run the installer on every rebuild.
