# Project notes for agents

Deliberate decisions in this repo - do NOT silently revert them:

- `homebrew.onActivation.cleanup = "zap"` in `configuration.nix` is intentional. It forces the good habit of declaring every Homebrew package in the Nix config instead of installing things ad-hoc, which keeps the machine reproducible. Do not soften it to `uninstall` or `none`. Users are warned about its effect in README.md; this note is for anyone tempted to change the setting itself.
- Never commit `.no-mistakes/` validation evidence to this public repo. `.no-mistakes/` is gitignored; if a validation pipeline stages evidence into a branch, drop it before merging.
- `configuration.nix` splits Homebrew casks into `basicCasks` (dev tooling, reusable on any future machine) and `personalCasks` (this Mac's GUI apps), gated by the `includePersonalCasks` module argument (required, no default - nix-darwin doesn't honor plain Nix argument defaults for custom module args, so every host's `specialArgs` in `flake.nix` must set it explicitly). Keep new personal-only tooling behind that flag rather than hardcoding it into the shared `casks` list.
- `flake.nix`'s `darwinConfigurations."basic"` host (fixed name, independent of the renamable `hostLabel`) sets `includePersonalCasks = false` and is the actual way to build/switch without personal apps. `bootstrap.sh`/`rebuild.sh` take a `--basic` flag to target it - deliberately a flag on the existing scripts, not separate `*-basic.sh` scripts, to stay consistent with the single-script-per-purpose + `hostLabel` pattern already established for the personal host.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
